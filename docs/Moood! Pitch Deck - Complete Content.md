## **SLIDE 2: THE PROBLEM**

**Visual**: Split screen - diseñador frustrado vs. output genérico

```
DESIGNERS WASTE 60% OF THEIR TIME
ON REPETITIVE, LOW-VALUE WORK

❌ 15 hours/week searching for inspiration
❌ 10 hours/week creating style guides manually
❌ 20 hours/week building layouts from scratch

But the REAL problem is worse...
```

## **SLIDE 3: THE REAL PROBLEM**

**Visual**: Comparación de productos con/sin design intent

```
CURRENT AI TOOLS GENERATE
"PRETTY" BUT SOULLESS DESIGNS

Lovable, v0, Galileo AI, etc. all fail at the same thing:

🎨 Beautiful colors ✓
📝 Nice typography ✓
🎯 Understand user intent ✗
💡 Solve real problems ✗
🧠 Design with purpose ✗

"Content is King" — but AI tools ignore it
```

---

## **SLIDE 4: THE INSIGHT**

**Visual**: Diagrama PRD → Design vs Design → PRD

```
THE BEST DESIGNS START WITH
A SOLID PRD, NOT PRETTY PIXELS

Traditional Flow (Wrong):
Design → Content → Code → Ship

Our Flow (Right):
PRD → Design System → Copy → Layouts → Ship

Every design decision backed by user intent
```
