## 💡 TALKING POINTS FOR INVESTORS

**If they ask about pricing**:

> "We've priced competitively with market leaders like Figma ($45/seat) and Adobe ($55/mo). Our Team tier at $199 for 5 seats ($40/seat) is actually 11% cheaper than Figma Organization while delivering 3 orchestrated AI agents. Enterprise at $999 reflects our early-stage positioning - we'll scale pricing as we add more enterprise features post-Series A."

**If they ask about lower ARR projections**:

> "We've taken a conservative approach to valuation. $14.4M ARR at Year 5 with a 7.5x multiple gives us $108M exit value and 77x ROI for early investors. This is achievable and defensible. If we exceed these projections - which we believe we will - the upside is significant."

**If they ask about profitability**:

> "We're targeting $6,000 MRR by Month 12, which covers our lean operating costs and makes us cash flow positive with our funding buffer. This gives us runway to scale without immediate Series A pressure, while still being positioned to raise when the time is right."

---

**Bottom Line**: These corrections make your deck more credible, more defensible, and still show excellent returns (77x ROI!). You'll close the $35K easily with these numbers. 🚀
