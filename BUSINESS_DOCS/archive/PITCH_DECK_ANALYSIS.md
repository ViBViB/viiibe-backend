### **Slides 11-15: Go-to-Market, Team, Investment**

**Slide 11 (Momentum Cascade)**:
- ✅ Phase 1: 500 users in 5 weeks (Viiibe!)
- ✅ Phase 2: 20% of Viiibe! users try PRD = 100 users
- ✅ Phase 3: 15,000 users in 6 months (Wriiite!)
- **Timeline consistency**: ✅

**Slide 12 (Why Moood! Wins)**:
- ✅ Competitive advantages are defensible
- ✅ "20% there (Viiibe! LIVE)" is accurate

**Slide 13 (Team)**:
- ✅ Alberto Contreras credentials
- ✅ 20+ years experience in product design

**Slide 14 (Phased Investment)**:

**Stage 1: $35K**
```
Use of Funds:
├─ Scale Viiibe! to 6,000 designs: $1,211 ✅
├─ Acquire 500 users: $3,000 ✅
├─ Founder salary (3 months): $15,000 ✅
├─ Infrastructure: $2,500 ✅
├─ Analytics system: $500 ✅
├─ Legal/Admin: $2,289 ✅
├─ Buffer: $3,000 ✅
└─ TOTAL: $27,500

Wait... this only adds to $27,500, not $35,000
```

⚠️ **DISCREPANCY FOUND**: Stage 1 use of funds = $27,500, not $35,000

**Missing**: $7,500

**Recommendation**: Add line item or adjust existing ones:
- Option 1: Increase Founder salary to $22,500 (still 3 months)
- Option 2: Add "Marketing & Community" $7,500
- Option 3: Increase Buffer to $10,500

**Stage 2: $50K**
```
Use of Funds:
├─ Moood! PRD Agent development: $15,000 ✅
├─ Founder salary (3 months): $15,000 ✅
├─ Infrastructure: $5,000 ✅
├─ Marketing: $15,000 ✅
├─ GPT-4 API costs: $2,500 ✅
├─ User testing & refinement: $2,500 ✅
├─ Legal/Admin: $2,000 ✅
└─ TOTAL: $57,000

Wait... this adds to $57,000, not $50,000
```

⚠️ **DISCREPANCY FOUND**: Stage 2 use of funds = $57,000, not $50,000

**Overage**: $7,000

**Recommendation**: Adjust line items:
- Reduce Marketing to $8,000 (from $15,000)
- OR reduce Founder salary to $12,000 (from $15,000)
- OR remove GPT-4 API costs (include in Infrastructure)

**Slide 15 (ROI Scenarios)**:

**$35K investment @ 4%**:
```
Conservative Exit ($50M):
├─ 4% diluted to 2.5% = $1,250,000
└─ ROI: $1,250,000 / $35,000 = 35.7x ✅

Realistic Exit ($150M):
├─ 4% diluted to 2.5% = $3,750,000
└─ ROI: $3,750,000 / $35,000 = 107x ✅

Optimistic Exit ($300M):
├─ 4% diluted to 2.5% = $7,500,000
└─ ROI: $7,500,000 / $35,000 = 214x ✅
```

**$85K total (both rounds)**:
```
Combined ownership: ~6%
Realistic Exit ($150M):
├─ 6% = $9,000,000
└─ ROI: $9,000,000 / $85,000 = 105.8x ≈ 105x ✅
```

✅ **All ROI calculations are CORRECT**

### **Slides 16-20: Milestones, Risks, Close**

**Slide 16 (Validation Gates)**:

**Month 3 (Post Mini Pre-Seed)**:
- ✅ 500 validated users
- ✅ 6,000 designs curated
- ✅ 4.5+ star rating on Figma
- ✅ 60% engagement rate
- ✅ Standalone agent model proven

**Month 6 (Post Seed)**:
- ✅ Moood! PRD functional

**Month 12**:
- ✅ Profitable ($2,700 MRR)

Wait, let me verify this:
```
Month 12 profitability check:
Revenue: $2,700 MRR
Costs: Founder salary ($5,000/mo) + Infrastructure ($500/mo) = $5,500/mo
Net: $2,700 - $5,500 = -$2,800/mo
```

⚠️ **ISSUE**: Not profitable at $2,700 MRR with $5,500/mo costs

**Recommendation**: Change to "Cash flow positive with initial funding" or increase MRR target to $6,000

---

## 💰 PRICING RECOMMENDATIONS

### **Current Platform Pricing**:
```
Starter:    $49/mo  ✅ KEEP
Pro:        $99/mo  ✅ KEEP
Team:       $299/mo ⚠️ REDUCE to $199/mo
Enterprise: $2,999/mo ⚠️ REDUCE to $999/mo OR REMOVE
```

### **Recommended Platform Pricing**:
```
Starter:    $49/mo  (2 agents)
Pro:        $99/mo  (3 agents)
Team:       $199/mo (5 seats = $40/seat)
Enterprise: $999/mo (unlimited) OR remove from deck
```

### **Why These Changes**:

**Team: $299 → $199**:
- Current: $60/seat (33% higher than Figma Org)
- Recommended: $40/seat (competitive with market)
- Still 4x standalone price (good margin)

**Enterprise: $2,999 → $999 or REMOVE**:
- Without proven enterprise customers, $2,999 is hard to justify
- $999 is more realistic for early-stage SaaS
- Alternative: Remove from initial deck, add after Series A

### **Impact on Projections**:

If you adjust Team and Enterprise pricing, Year 3 Platform MRR changes:

**Current**:
```
Team: 150 × $299 = $44,850
Enterprise: 50 × $2,999 = $149,950
Subtotal: $194,800
```

**Recommended**:
```
Team: 150 × $199 = $29,850
Enterprise: 50 × $999 = $49,950
Subtotal: $79,800
```

**Difference**: -$115,000 MRR

**New Year 3 Total**:
```
Standalone: $90,000
Platform: $208,000 (was $323,000)
Total MRR: $298,000 (was $413,000)
ARR: $3,576,000 (was $4,956,000)
```

This is still **very strong** and more realistic.

**Year 5 would adjust proportionally**:
```
Current ARR: $19.8M
Adjusted ARR: ~$14M
Valuation: $105M (at 7.5x multiple)
```

**ROI Impact**:
```
Current Realistic Exit: $150M → 107x ROI
Adjusted Realistic Exit: $105M → 75x ROI
```

Still **excellent** ROI, just more conservative and believable.

## 🎯 FINAL RECOMMENDATIONS

### **MUST FIX** (Before Investor Meeting):

1. **Fix Use of Funds Math**:
   - Stage 1: Add $7,500 (suggest: Marketing & Community)
   - Stage 2: Reduce $7,000 (suggest: Marketing to $8K)

2. **Fix Month 12 Profitability**:
   - Change to "Cash flow positive with funding buffer"
   - OR increase MRR target to $6,000

### **SHOULD CONSIDER** (For Credibility):

3. **Adjust Platform Pricing**:
   - Team: $299 → $199/mo
   - Enterprise: $2,999 → $999/mo OR remove

4. **Update Projections** (if pricing changes):
   - Year 3 ARR: $4.95M → $3.58M
   - Year 5 ARR: $19.8M → $14M
   - Realistic Exit: $150M → $105M
   - ROI: 107x → 75x (still excellent!)

### **OPTIONAL** (Nice to Have):

5. **Add Slide 10.5**: Detailed revenue breakdown table
6. **Add Appendix**: Sensitivity analysis
7. **Prepare**: Answers for "Why not lower pricing?"

## 🚀 BOTTOM LINE

**Your pitch deck is 90% excellent!**

**Strengths**:
- ✅ Compelling narrative
- ✅ Clear value proposition
- ✅ Realistic user growth
- ✅ Sound financial model
- ✅ Strong ROI for investors

**Weaknesses**:
- ⚠️ Platform pricing too aggressive
- ❌ Use of funds math errors

**Recommendation**:
1. Fix the math errors (MUST)
2. Adjust platform pricing (SHOULD)
3. You'll have a bulletproof deck

**With adjustments, this deck will close the $35K easily and position you well for $50K seed.** 🚀

---

**Your instinct about pricing was CORRECT** - Team and Enterprise are too high for an early-stage product without proven enterprise customers. Lower them and you'll be more credible.
