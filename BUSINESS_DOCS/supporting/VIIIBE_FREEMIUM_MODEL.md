## 💡 INVESTOR TALKING POINTS

### **"Why freemium instead of paid-only?"**

> "Freemium dramatically lowers the barrier to entry. We can acquire 5,000 users instead of 300 for the same marketing spend. Those 5,000 users become our funnel for both PRO upgrades (6% = 300 paid) AND platform adoption (20% of PRO = 60 platform users). It's a dual traction wheel - external (Figma Community → FREE users) and internal (FREE → PRO → Platform)."

### **"What's your conversion rate assumption?"**

> "We're using 6% FREE to PRO conversion, which is conservative for freemium SaaS. Industry benchmarks show 2-5% for generic tools, but we have a strong value prop: Figma integration is essential for professional designers. Once they see the value in FREE tier, upgrading to PRO for one-click Figma export is a no-brainer."

### **"How does this affect your metrics?"**

> "It makes them much stronger. Instead of 300 paid users, we have 5,300 total users (5,000 FREE + 300 PRO). That's 17x more users to upsell to the platform. Our engagement metrics are better, our word-of-mouth is stronger, and we have a much larger funnel for Moood! platform adoption."

### **"What's the cost of supporting FREE users?"**

> "Minimal. Our infrastructure costs are ~$500/mo regardless of user count (Vercel serverless scales automatically). The AI analysis is done once per design (6,000 designs = $1,211 one-time cost). Serving results to FREE users is essentially zero marginal cost. The FREE tier is pure traction."
