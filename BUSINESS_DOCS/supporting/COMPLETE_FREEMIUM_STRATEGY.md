## 💡 INVESTOR TALKING POINTS

### **"Why the same freemium model for all agents?"**

> "Each agent has a natural upgrade trigger. For Viiibe!, it's Figma integration. For Wriiite!, it's long-form content and multi-language. For Buiiild!, it's code export. The FREE tier proves value, the PRO tier unlocks workflow. This pattern works across all creative tools - users try for free, upgrade when they need it for real work."

### **"What if users stay on FREE forever?"**

> "That's actually good for us. FREE users are our marketing engine - they share mood boards, headlines, and layouts with colleagues. Each FREE user is a potential referral source. And we only pay infrastructure costs once they convert to PRO or Platform, so FREE users are essentially zero marginal cost marketing."

### **"How do you prevent abuse of FREE tier?"**

> "We use rate limits that are generous for exploration but restrictive for production. For example, Wriiite! FREE gives 5 generations per day - enough to try different headlines, but not enough to write a full website. Buiiild! FREE gives 3 layouts per day - enough to explore options, but not enough to build an app. The limits are designed to encourage upgrade, not frustrate users."
