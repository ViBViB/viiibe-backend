## 📊 CONVERSION MATH

### **STARTER → PRO BASIC** (6% conversion)

**Trigger**: After first project completion  
**Offer**: "Ready to download? Try PRO BASIC free for 5 days"  
**Math**: 5,000 STARTER × 6% = 300 PRO BASIC  
**MRR**: 300 × $49 = $14,700

---

### **PRO BASIC → PRO ADVANCED** (80% upgrade)

**Trigger**: After 2-3 months or when needing Figma Sites  
**Offer**: "Unlock Figma Sites + unlimited projects"  
**Math**: 300 PRO BASIC × 80% = 240 upgrade to ADVANCED  
**Additional MRR**: $0 (same price, better features)

---

### **PRO → ENTERPRISE** (15% upgrade)

**Trigger**: After 3 months or when needing code export  
**Offer**: "Export production-ready code"  
**Math**: 2,000 PRO × 15% = 300 ENTERPRISE  
**Additional MRR**: 300 × ($99 - $49) = $15,000

---

## 🎯 WHY THIS STRATEGY WORKS

### **1. Complete Value in FREE Tier**

**Problem**: Most freemium models give you a "taste" but not a complete product.

**Moood! Solution**: STARTER tier gives you a **complete landing page**. You can use it immediately. No artificial limits on core functionality.

**Result**: Users love it, tell friends, viral growth.

---

### **2. Natural Upgrade Triggers**

**Problem**: Users don't upgrade because they don't see the value.

**Moood! Solution**: Upgrade triggers are **pain points**, not arbitrary limits:
- "Tired of manual setup?" → PRO BASIC (Figma variables)
- "Need Figma Sites?" → PRO ADVANCED
- "Need code?" → ENTERPRISE

**Result**: Users upgrade when they **need** it, not when we force them.

---

### **3. Same Price, Better Features (PRO BASIC → ADVANCED)**

**Problem**: Users resist price increases.

**Moood! Solution**: PRO BASIC and PRO ADVANCED are **same price** ($49/mo). Upgrade is about **features**, not cost.

**Result**: 80% of PRO BASIC users upgrade to ADVANCED because there's no price barrier.

---

### **4. Clear Value Ladder**

**Problem**: Users don't understand the upgrade path.

**Moood! Solution**: Clear progression:
- **FREE**: Complete landing page (manual setup)
- **PRO BASIC**: Figma variables + components (save time)
- **PRO ADVANCED**: Figma Sites + unlimited (scale)
- **ENTERPRISE**: Code export + deployment (ship faster)

**Result**: Users see the path and upgrade when ready.

## 💡 COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES

### **vs. Figma Plugins**

**Figma Plugins**: Single-purpose tools (e.g., just icons, just copy, just layouts)

**Moood!**: **Complete solution** from intent to shipped product. All agents work together.

---

### **vs. AI Design Tools (Lovable, v0, Galileo)**

**AI Tools**: Keyword-based, generic outputs, no intent understanding

**Moood!**: **Intent-driven**, conversational, understands **WHY** you're building

---

### **vs. No-Code Platforms (Webflow, Framer)**

**No-Code**: Template-based, limited customization, steep learning curve

**Moood!**: **Conversational**, no templates, generates custom designs based on intent

2. ✅ **Natural upgrade triggers** - Pain points, not artificial limits
3. ✅ **Clear value ladder** - Users see the path
4. ✅ **Proven model** - Figma, Notion, Slack all use freemium
