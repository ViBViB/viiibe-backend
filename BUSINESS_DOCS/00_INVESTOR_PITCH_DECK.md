## SLIDE 3: SOLUTION (Conversations, Not Keywords!)

```
SOLUTION

Conversations, Not
Keywords!

Moood! is a Multi-Agent AI Platform that understands user intent
and orchestrates specialized agents.

[Chat interface mockup showing:]

User:
I need a homepage for a disruptive bank in Manila targeting
crypto-savvy millennials

Moood!:
Got it! Tell me more about the vibe - are we
going vanguard tech-forward like Revolut? Or
more playful?

User:
Vanguard tech-forward for sure

Moood!:
Ok. Let me grab some inspirations for you.
[Selecting sources...]
How about these ones? Do they fit?

## SLIDE 4: MARKET OPPORTUNITY

```
MARKET OPPORTUNITY

$50B Total Addressable
Market

Market Trends:
• AI tools exploding (ChatGPT moment)
• No-code movement accelerating
• Designer shortage (demand > supply)
• Intent-driven AI is next frontier

Competition:
• Lovable, v0, Galileo: Generic AI (no intent understanding)
• Figma plugins: Keyword-based (limiting)

Moood!: Is the first conversational, intent-driven platform

[Circular diagram showing:]
TAM: $50B
├─ AI DEV TOOLS: $15B
├─ NO-CODE PLATFORMS: $20B
├─ DESIGN TOOLS: $15B

## SLIDE 5: PROBLEM

```
PROBLEM

Designers Waste 60% of
Their Time on Repetitive
Work

15+ hours/week searching for inspiration before starting
projects

• Browse Pinterest, Dribbble, Behance endlessly
• Filter through thousands of generic results
• Never quite find the right vibe
• Killing momentum and creativity

Current AI tools make it worse:
• Generic outputs (no context)
• Keyword-based (limiting)
• One-size-fits-all (soulless)
• Don't understand user intent

TOOLS DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY YOU'RE BUILDING SOMETHING

## SLIDE 18: RISKS & MITIGATION

```
RISKS & MITIGATION (TRANSPARENCY)

What Could Go Wrong?

Risks:                          Mitigations:

Users don't adopt              • Viiibe! standalone still works
conversational interface       • Can pivot to improved keyword search
                              • Modular architecture allows flexibility

Competitors copy the model     • First-mover advantage (2+ year head start)
                              • Curated content library (expensive to replicate)
                              • Multi-agent orchestration (very hard)

One agent fails               • Other agents continue independently
                              • Modular validation reduces risk
                              • Standalone revenue continues

Market timing                 • AI tools are exploding NOW
                              • Designer shortage is real
                              • Intent-driven is next frontier
                              • We're early, not too early
```

## SLIDE 19: WHY NOW

```
WHY NOW

Perfect Storm of Opportunities

AI Moment
• ChatGPT proved conversational AI works
• Users expect AI to understand intent
• Generic AI tools are saturating
• Opportunity: Be first with intent-driven design AI

Designer Shortage
• Demand > Supply globally
• Companies desperate for design speed
• No-code movement accelerating
• Opportunity: 10x designer productivity

Figma Dominance
• 4M+ designers on Figma
• Plugin ecosystem thriving
• No conversational plugins yet
• Opportunity: First-mover in massive ecosystem

Capital Efficiency
• Can validate with $35K (not $500K)
• AI-assisted development
• Modular approach reduces risk
• Opportunity: Prove model cheaply
