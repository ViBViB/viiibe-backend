# Check Upstash Reset Date

## How to Find Reset Date

1. Go to https://console.upstash.com
2. Select your database
3. Look for "Usage" or "Billing" section
4. Should show:
   - Current usage: 500,000 / 500,000
   - **Reset date** or **Billing cycle reset**

## Typical Reset Schedules

**Free Plan:**
- Usually resets on the 1st of each month
- Or 30 days from account creation

**Current Date:** December 25, 2024

**Possible Reset Dates:**
- If monthly: January 1, 2025 (7 days wait)
- If from creation: Check your account creation date + 30 days

## Quick Check

Run this to see when you created your Upstash account:
- Check your email for "Welcome to Upstash" 
- Add 30 days to that date

## My Recommendation

**If reset is more than 3-4 days away:**
- Don't wait, upgrade or create new DB
- You're losing productive time

**If reset is 1-2 days away:**
- Might be worth waiting
- But you can't save any pins until then

## Tell Me

Check your Upstash console and tell me:
- What's the reset date?
- Then we can decide if waiting makes sense
