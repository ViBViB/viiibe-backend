# Upstash Plan Check - Quick Guide

## Go to Upstash Console

https://console.upstash.com

## What to Look For

1. **Select your Redis database** (the one used for viiibe-plugin)

2. **Check "Details" tab:**
   - Plan name (Free, Pay as you go, Pro)
   - Monthly request limit
   - Current usage (should show 500,000 / 500,000)
   - Reset date

3. **Tell me:**
   - What plan name do you see?
   - When does it reset?

## Quick Solutions

### If Free Plan:
- Upgrade to Pay as you go
- Cost: ~$0.20 per 100K requests
- No monthly limit

### If Already Paid:
- Check if you can increase limit
- Or wait for monthly reset
